  <h2>About My Research</h2>
  <p>
Francesco Santoro was born in 1994, but his development was tragically interrupted at the age of 14, when he realized he wanted to devote himself to study. Considered himself a "complete time waster" until the age of 21, Francesco then decided to apply his talent for geology in the direction of mineralogy. His work includes a Marie Curie doctorate still ongoing at the University of Granada and various social participations for representation from high school to doctorate, the possibility of having a thousand passions including music, climbing, combat sports and padel but not being able to conclude even one. Lives around Europe based in Granada. Stubborn in following his bizarre ideas, the drive to connect to the maritime environment with fishing and nautical patents, the rebirth of the cult of calcite and its pillars, and the creation of useless scientific articles on the stabilization of prenucleation amorphous phases. He's trying to add his mother's family last name to his name because it's cooler to read in articles and is more respectful to the family, but he's too lazy to do the paperwork. In love with the cult of Milan's international and considers the discovery of pasta as the greatest leap in human progress until the invention of the Internet.
